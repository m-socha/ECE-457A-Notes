    \subsection{Overview of Topics}
      This is a course that approaches artificial intelligence by examining various algorithms that adapt to their
      environment and cooperate with one another. Topics include:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Algorithms that exhibit intelligent behavior
        \item Concepts of adaptation and cooperation between algorithms
        \item Meta-heuristics, evolutionary computing methods, swarm intelligence, ant-colony algorithms, and particle
        swarm methods
        \item Apply the above ideas to solve various (often ill-structured) continuous and discrete problems
      \end{itemize}

  \section{Introduction}

    \subsection{What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?}
      Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. AI is the science of creating intelligent machines,
      including intelligent computer programs. Sample applications include visual perception, speech recognition and various
      forms of decision-making

      \subsubsection{AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning vs Data Science}
        The above terms are often thrown around almost interchangealbly, but they refer to different things. Deep learning is
        a type of machine learning, which is a type of AI. Data science is a separate field that has some overlap with these
        three other concepts.

      \subsubsection{Inspiration from Nature}
        Some of the inspirations for intelligent systems come from the natural world. Sample inspirations include ant path-finding,
        bird flocking, and fish schooling.

    \subsection{Thinking Rationally vs Behaving Rationally}
      In rational thinking, logical systems are used to achieve goals via inferencing. It can be hard to represent informal knowledge,
      and not all problems can be solved through such methods (e.g. problems with uncertainty).

      In rational behavior, a perceives its environment and acts to achieve goals according to some set of beliefs. This is a more
      general approach than inferencing, and actions taken to achieve a goal may not necessarily be optimal or ``correct'', but
      may be an acceptable solution anyways.
      
    \subsection{Swarm Intelligence}
      Swarm intelligence is an AI technique that builds systems based on the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized units.
      There are no centralized control structures, with agents only interacting with each other and the environment.

    \subsection{Intelligent Agents}
      An agent is something that senses its environment and acts on the collected information. A rational agent acts in a way that is
      expected to maximize performance on the basis of perceptual history and built-in knowledge. Types of agents include:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Simple Reflex Agents:} Follow a lookup-table approach; needs fully observable environment
        \item \textbf{Model-Based Reflex Agents:} Add state information to handle partially observable environments
        \item \textbf{Goal-Based Agents:} Add concept of goals to help choose actions
        \item \textbf{Utility-Based Agents:} Add utility to decide ``good'' or ``'bad'' when faced with conflicting goals
        \item \textbf{Learning Agents:} Add ability to learn from experience to improve performance
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Environments}
      The environments in which agents operate influence the design of the agents. Types of environments include:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Fully vs Partially Observable:} In fully observable environments, sensors can detect all aspects
        relevant to choice of action. This is not the case in partially observable environments, which may exist because
        of missing information or inaccurate sensors.
        \item \textbf{Deterministic vs Stochastic:} Deterministic environments are only influenced by their current
        state and the next action executed by the agent; otherwise, the environment is stochastic.
        \item \textbf{Episodic vs Sequential:} In episodic environments, the choice of action in each episode does not
        depend on previous episodes, unlike in sequential environments, where an agent needs to ``think ahead''.
        \item \textbf{Static vs Dynamic:} Environments where the state may change while the agent is deliberating are
        considered dynamic; other environments are considered static.
        \item \textbf{Discrete vs Continuous:} A discrete/continuous distinction can be applied to various aspects of
        an environment, including the way time flow is handled and to the actions of the agent.
        \item \textbf{Single vs Multi Agent}
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Adaptive and Cooperative Algorithms}
      Adaptive algorithms are able to change their behavior as they are run. Cooperative algorithms algorithms work
      together to solve a joint problem, communicating either directly or indirectly with one another.

  \section{Search Problem Formulation}
    The first step in solving a search problem lies in formulation. Sources of potential complexity in formalizing and
    solving real-world search problems include multimodality, lack of a mathematical model, non-differentiability, and
    a combinatoric or distributed nature.

    \subsection{Well-Structured vs Ill-Structured Problems}
      In well-structured problems, the existing and end state are well-defined, and so are the actions that can be taken
      to change state. In ill-structured problems, the existing state is well-defined, but the end state and actions to
      change state are typically undefined.

    \subsection{Optimization Problems}
      Optimization problems concern finding the ``best'' solution from a set of solutions subject to a set of constraints.
      Optimization techniques are search methods where the goal is to find a solution to an optimization problem. Optimization
      techniques can be divided into exact algorithms, where an optimal solution is found but often at a very high computational
      cost, and approximate solutions, where a near-optimal solution is found at a far lower computational cost.

      \subsubsection{Approximation Methods}
        Due to their relatively low computational costs, approximation methods are often preferred for solving problems of a
        combinatorial nature where heuristics can be applied to find near-optimal solutions. Approaches to approximation can
        be divided into constructive methods, where a solution is built up one component at a time, and local search methods,
        where actions are iteratively applied to some initial solution to attempt to improve it.

    \subsection{Goal and Problem Formulation}
      In goal formulation, decisions are made on which aspects of a problem are important and which can be ignored. Problem
      formulation concerns determining how to manipulate these important aspects. Goal formulation followed by problem
      formulation yields the following information:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{State space:} Complete or partial configuration of a problem
        \item \textbf{Initial state:} State in which search begins
        \item \textbf{Goal state:} State in which search ends
        \item \textbf{Action set:} Set of possible transitions between states
        \item \textbf{Cost:} Can be used to compare various solutions
      \end{itemize}

      Generally speaking, a closed-world assumption can be followed, meaning that each state is a complete description of the world.
      Environments in closed-world problems are typically fully observable, deterministic, sequential, static, and discrete.
